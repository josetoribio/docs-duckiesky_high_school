[Student version](+duckiesky_high_school_student#localization-camera-images)

<div class='requirements' markdown='1'>

Requires: 
Base Station and Drone

Result: 
Students will succesfully draw a 
map and upload the picture to the drone.

**Knowledge** -

- The ability to combine different pictures to make a map

- Know the purpose of unique particles

- Know the general process to start a map for the localization python script

## Lesson Title
Camera Image

### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)
_NGSS: HS - PS4 - 5_: Communicate technical information about how some machines use pictures to capture information and localize.


### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding
By the end of the lesson, students are able to understand the drones relationship with the map, as well as how to properly edit multiple pictures to combine into 1 map.

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)
suggestion:Form groups of 3 or 4 students.

10 min: Get students to draw unique patterns on paper, for the class map.

15 min: begin to have students take pictures of the map in sections.

15 min: Fun exercise to help students stitch the pictures taken.

10 min: Students should ssh into the drones newtwork and Securely Transfer Files using the Terminal.
### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_


### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Materials needed**
Paper 
Markers
posters.
Drone
Base Station
**Classroom Set Up**
Teacher can write a DO NOW on the board for students to think about why the camera is pointed down?


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 10 mintues

**Hook:**

Exercise: Students brainstorm and discuss in groups how 1 particle can be use to localize.Encourage students to apply vocabulary from lessons.

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 25 minutes

The main lesson is exercising what the students learned in the previous chapter about Particle filters and Localization.
### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes
Question 1.)Using vocabulary learned in this lesson, what is a map?

Answer:
A map is a fix area used to capture particles to help the drone localize

Question 2. Why is each pattern on the map unique?
(also Refer to the [lesson](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/downloads/duckiesky_high_school_student/docs-duckiesky_high_school_student/branch/daffy-develop/duckiesky_high_school_student/out/localization_camera_localization.html))

Answer: <div/>
Each drawing has to be unique, so the paricle can be recognized at a location on the map.

Pause for discussion if necessary

Question 3. What Linux terminal command did you do to securely transfer files from your base Station onto the Drone?

Answer. The terminal command used is SCP.SCP is a linux command to securely copy files to directories between 2 locations.The 2 locations are the basestation and the drone.
